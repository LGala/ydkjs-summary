# Get Started - 2nd edition - Chapter 1 - What Is JavaScript?

<br>

## What's With That Name
- real name: ECMAScript

<br>

## Language Specification
- TC39 manages the language specification, that is consequently submitted to ECMA
- TC39 has 5 stages, 0 is initial stage and 4 is something eligible to be included in the lang

<br>

## The Web Rules Everything About (JS)
- The browsers can't introduce every features the ECMA wants. If a new feature breaks some websites, ECMA possibly changes that.
- Sometimes ECMA doesn't change a browser-braking features, and so the JS specification and the implementation may differ a bit.
- The runtimes, since don't have the problems a browser can have, are forced to implement the whole specification.

<br>

## Not All (Web) JS...
- a JS environment (a browser for example) can add some APIs in the global scope (like fetch, alert)

<br>

## It's Not Always JS
- a JS REPL it doesn't handle the code like a JS engine handles a .js file

<br>

## Many Faces
- JS is multi-paradigm

<br>

## Backwards & Forwards
- JS is 99.9% backward compatible (old code works in new versions of engines) because old websites can't break.

<br>

## Jumping the Gaps
- JS is not forward compatible (new code doesn't work in old engines) and so we can use tools like Babel: it transpiles the new JS version code to an old JS version code in order to make this new code be then compatible with the old engine.

<br>

## Filling the Gaps
- What happens if I want to provide forward compatibility for an engine native API? I can create a polyfill: when transpiling the code for an old engine version I provide an implementation for this missing new API using a valid old syntax to simulate the new API. 
- For example: the promise method ```finally``` doesn't exist in a pre ES2019 engine, and so if I want to use this method in a ES2015 engine, during the transpilation I need to provide a fallback implementation with valid ES2015 syntax.

example

```javascript
// ES2019 new method
if (!Promise.prototype.finally) {
  // provide an implementation with valid ES2015 syntax
}
```

<br>

## What's in an Interpretation?
- JS is parsed to an AST, the AST is then compiled to a sort of bytecode and the latter is then executed
- Thanks to this compiling phase, a static analysis phase is done, and so we can get errors before the code execution

<br>

## Web Assembly (WASM)
- representation/language directly understood by the JS engine without compilations phases
- initially created for on performances, is now also focused to be a sort of web lingua franca, you can possibly transpile your favorite language code to wasm and run it on the web.

<br>

## Strictly Speaking
- strict mode is a mod activated by the statement ```"use strict";``` in a file or in a function, used to limit some possibly dangerous/inefficient features (like calling the function parameters with the same name) at a compile and run times.

# Get Started - 2nd edition - Chapter 2 - Surveying JS

<br>

## Each File is a Program
- each .js file is evaluated as a separate program (unless some build tools merge all the code together in a single file) that shares its state (for example with export) in the global scope and can cooperate with any another program/.js file 

<br>

## Values
- 2 types: primitives (number, string, boolean, bigint, null, undefined, symbol) and object

<br>

## Arrays And Objects
- array is a special object with indexes as keys
- keys in objects are strings

<br>

## Value Type Determination
- ```typeof``` keyword returns inconsistent results (look at null/undefined and array/function)

example

```javascript
typeof undefined;           // "undefined"
typeof null;                // "object"
typeof { "a": 1 };          // "object"
typeof [1,2,3];             // "object"
typeof function hello(){};  // "function"
```

<br>

## Declaring and Using Variables
- ```var```: function scoped variable 
- ```let```: block scoped variable 
- ```const```: block scoped constant
- ```function```: like ```var sum = () => {...}```
- function parameter: block scoped variable (like ```let```)
- declare exception variable in ```catch()```: block scoped variable (like ```let```)

example

```javascript
if (adult) {
    var myName = "Kyle";
    let age = 39;
}

console.log(myName);
// Kyle

console.log(age);
// Error!
```

<br>

## Comparisons
- ```===``` check value and type equality for primitives values (most of the time)
- ```NaN === NaN``` is ```false```, in that case, is better using ```Number.isNaN(..)```
- ```0 === -0``` is ```true```
- another way to solve the ```===```strange equalities is using ```Object.is(..)```, which is the true check value and type equality method for primitives values.

<br>

## Coercive Comparisons
- ```==```, ```>```, ```<```, ```>=```, ```<=``` permits coercion

<br>

## Classic Modules
- just functions

example

```javascript
function Publication(title,author,pubDate) {
    var publicAPI = {
        print() {
            console.log(`
                Title: ${ title }
                By: ${ author }
                ${ pubDate }
            `);
        }
    };

    return publicAPI;
}
```

<br>

## ES Modules
- `Ã¬mport` just use the same variable reference `export` ed

<br>

<br>

## Iteration
- Iterator is a data struct that iterates/retrieves data one chunk at a time (like stream)
- `next()` returns the next chunk, that's an object with `done`and `value` property

<br>

## Consuming Iterators
- `for..of` and `...` can consume iterables (= objects with the iteration protocol implemented)
- strings, arrays, maps, sets are iterables
